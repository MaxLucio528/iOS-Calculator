# iOS-Calculator

Made by: Max Lucio Martins de Assis.

This project is a simple page that has a iOS Calculator implemented with JavaScript, inspired by a project from Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to Web Development](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) course, in which the students are asked to make a iOS Calculator, this is my version of this project. It's compatible with (probably) any web browser.

Current Version: 1.0
